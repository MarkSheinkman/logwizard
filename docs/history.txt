- todo: 
  move filter_ctrl completely in lw_common
  test notes_ctrl



1.0.91f DOES NOT COMPILE
- BEFORE filter_ctrl have filter_item point directly to ui_view

- moving filter_ctrl into lw_common - step 3
- done: to erase 
  private void focusOnFilterCtrl_Tick(object sender, EventArgs e) {



1.0.91e
- moving filter_ctrl into lw_common - step 2
  (solved font bug)


1.0.91d
- moving filter_ctrl into lw_common - step 1


1.0.91c
- refactoring: names in lw_common should be in lw_common namespace


1.0.91b
- refactoring - moved some UI code into lw_common
  rationale: I want to be able to test parts of the UI separately (like, the control I'm about to do: notes_ctrl)


1.0.91a
- sheletron (filter_ctrl on test_ui)


1.0.90
- added notes ctrl (scheletron)


1.0.89
- notes: author name, initials + color ->  in settings
  - the author has 2 names - the name + a short name, since we will be showing his shot name in discussions (by default, it's he user's initials -> we compute them as he's changing his name)
- zip extensions -> in settings
- cool color selector in filter - it updates the correct line (if another color was selected) or adds a new line with the color



1.0.88
- https://github.com/jtorjo/logwizard/wiki/Filters
- added color picker (http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/21965/Color-Picker-with-Color-Wheel-and-Eye-Dropper)
- settings -> general / color / Imp/Exp (+ Reset button) / notes
- no more need for update_line_highlight_color



1.0.87
- custom renderer - right now, we can draw custom words/phrases/etc. with different fonts, bold, etc. (list_view_render)
  we need to make it so that we can match anything a filter or a find matches


1.0.86
- added + tested sharpzip - ****awesome lib****


1.0.85
- side effect, of course, everything is smoother, and loads faster, since we don't need to reload matches on the main thread
  (they are loaded in the filter' tread)

- decrease memory footprint - step 11
	- log_view: remove usages of list.GetItemCount()
	- log_view: remove usages of GetItem() - always check for null
	- fix the "needs to scroll to last"


- another possible memory optimization for large files (for much later, probably)
  - load the file in chunks. for each chunk, parse the lines, and then run ALL the filters on that specific chunk of lines
    load another chunk, parse lines, run all filters, and so on.
	this way, we keep very little in large_string (except for line indexes)
	then, when specific lines are asked (for display) - load them from HDD, with some simple caching mechanism
	possible problem - if file is not Unicode-16 or Ascii, we need to match the line index to a specific position in the file
	                   this will probably mean a totatly new large_string class, that would internally keep bytes
					   also in text_file_reader -> in that case, we could pass to large_string -> the bytes themselves (with encoding as well)
  - having said that, this would probably be useful only on 3-4GB+ files (since those could indeed take a lot of memory)
    - for such large files, i may even add an option: pause/resume loading


1.0.84c
- log_view and filter share the matches list
  - on the 90Mb file /64bit - improvement - takes 915-920Mb, used to take aprox 1Gb, so improvent of about 9%
  - on the 280Mb file/64bit - improvement - takes 2340Mb instead of aprox 2750Mb, so improvement of about 15%


1.0.84a
- removed filter.match_indexes_


1.0.83e
- update hotkeys page (mayber online?)- explain toggles in document - so that I can send to Denise.
  - yes, made help page online


1.0.83d
- msg only -> show the line + msg (at this time, i only show msg)
  - save it for EACH view + full log
  - full log: should toggle between line+msg / line+view+msg / everything


1.0.83c
- keeping the ui_info in the context itself seems to make no sense - it quite complicates things - we already keep the position info outside (default_ui_, context_ui_)


1.0.83b
- ' ' toggle between enabled/dimmed in the filter (if on a filter row)
- + - <-V-> etc - buttons should override the header (if the header is visible!)
  - small bug: if both header and views are hidden, the buttons are placed wrongly


1.0.83a
- optimization: filter -> when a filter row is modified / added / or deleted -> I should check exactly that -> so that when updating rows -> reuse what has not been modified
  - bug: move up/down -> sometimes it does not update the "Found" column - also, sometimes it's not updated at all (we should care when filter moved up/down/top/bottom)
    (whe should i recompute "Found" column?)
- if editing a filter row, don't update the filter until the user has gone away from it
- home/end/esc/' '/enter - should work correctly when history dropdown shown
- history dropdown: closing the dropdown -> move focus away from history
  - if title hidden - show it partially
      - ctrl-h -> should show history - if the title is toggled off, just bring the history part to visibility, and then hide it back
  tested, actually, I don't need to show it - dropping teh Dropdown will show all the items in the history, which is exactly what we want.


1.0.82
- udated saving/toggling positions - made MUCH EASIER
  
- Saving/Toggling positions
	  the "position" now encompases: 
	  - application position + size
	  - whether app was maximized or not
	  - last selected view
	  - last selected row
	  - full log splitter position
	  - all toggles

  By default, you're in the "Default" position (you can also call it, position zero). Anything you do is automatically saved.
  At any time, you can switch to another to another position (1 to 5).
  To switch to another position, press Ctrl-1 to Ctrl-5. 
  To switch back to the default position (position zero), just press the hotkey again.

  When going to position 1-5:
  - if you're going there for the first time, the existing position is copied. This works even if
    you're in another position. 
	So, if you're going to position 2, and you were in the default position, the default position is copied into position 2.
	If you're going into position 2 from position 1, the position 1 is copied into position 2.

	From there on, anything you do is saved within this position.
	To go back to the default position, just press the Ctrl-(1 to 5) hotkey again.



1.0.81
- Saving/Toggling positions (+ toggles)
  the "position" now encompases: 
  - application position + size
  - whether app was maximized or not
  - last selected view
  - last selected row
  - full log splitter position
  - all toggles

  Ctrl-Shift-1 to Ctrl-Shift-5 
  - saves the position
  
  Ctrl-1 to Ctrl-5 
  - toggles the position (from the default position to a customly-saved position and back)
  - you can also toggle from one customly-saved position to another customly saved position
  - whenyou are in a Customly-saved position, any change you make to the position is ignored
    (so if you're in position 3 and toggle Title OFF, next time you will toggle to position 3, the Title will be ON;
	 if you make some changes to the position, and want them to update, just re-save the position; 
	 in our case, you would just re-press Ctrl-Shift-3)

  Ctrl-Shift-0
  - marks the current position as the "Default" (which you can automatically tweak further)

  Ctrl-0
  - goes to the position saved by Ctrl-Shift-0
  - remains in "Default" position (does not go into a "Custom" position)
    what this means, is that any changes you make further on, are saved as the "Default" position.



1.0.80j
- fix: small bug: if switch from one custom location to another custom location, it does not work correctly


1.0.80i
- done:  what if on a custom location , changed something and want to resave
- small bug: if switch from one custom location to another custom location, it does not work correctly


1.0.80h
- everything saved correctly - toggling to/from different locations works correctly
- still todo:  what if on a custom location , changed something and want to resave 


1.0.80g
- still bug when hiding tabs and title


1.0.80f
- select line - saved + restored correctly


1.0.80e
- selected view - saved correctly


1.0.80d
- position + maximized + full-log-splitter-distance - saved correctly


1.0.80c
- Esc - if message details is shown - hide it
- refactored the UI-toggles code, to allow for sets of locations/sizes/toggles - NOT complete


1.0.80b
- find - case-insensitive + full words + regex (by default, auto-detect -> [],(),any\ -> regex)
- new default: synchronize colors - with all


1.0.80a
- changed toggle hotkeys - so that they are not single chars (without modifiers like Alt/Ctrl/Shift)
  - due to feedback: the user should not by mistake press a key while in LogWizard and not understand what happens (i.e., freak out)
  - former hotkeys now are Alt-[former_hotkey]; example : toggle filter - Alt-F
- show/toggle status: works (Alt-S)
  - new hotkey for toggling source pane (Alt-O)
- status: just show the file + length, just to show something there, for now
- alt-'s' - toggle status (info about the file/current view - like, file size, number of lines, how many lines the last Find matched; when loading a file -> write status about it)
  - setting a status - either for a number of seconds (after we we get to the previous one), or indefinitely (clears previous queue)
  - what about source pane? what hotkey for it - - alt-o


1.0.79
- allow selecting several rows
- allow resetting the default settings (for Denise)


1.0.77
- toggle 'v' - show/hide view + 'h' show/hide header
  - global - they apply to all views
- show_full_log() -> split into two things -> show_full_log / show_current_view (both can't be off at the same time)
- all toggles are saved into current context (except "show msgonly")
- fix bug: toggle full log -> when pressed ('l') in full-log, it's pressed twice
- history - deleted files - ignore them
- synchronizing with full-log/other logs -> if key is down (up/down/etc.) -> don't sync yet TOTHINK (basically so that we only synchronize when the user has selected the final row)


1.0.76h
- after generated 32 and 64 setup kits

- Decrease memory - final step TODO:
  - log_view has an array of items (_model), which basically are on top of matches_
    I guess we can actually get rid of log_view.item, and embody it match_ - I do have to think about it big time
	I should also think about the fact that I may want to toggle the results of a view + search-in-view (but that should be fine,
	I would just go through the original filter, and do my search, create a copy of the array, with the search; now that i think about it,
	i could even keep another array with the results of a search - if no search, just an empty array; this should also work for when selecting a filter -> which would show the
	results of that filter; at this point - I can easily find out the number of matches to hold)
  - match_indexes_ -> the only time I actually use this is when adding an addition via BinarySearch
    - since i already have binary_search myself, I should look into that 
	  (also - my search returns the closest item; i should see if that is the right place to do an Insert).


1.0.76g
- decrease memory footprint - step 10

- full log : matches computed on the fly (instead of an extra array, which also meant huge delays when we changed the current view)
- full log : computing synchronized colors on the fly - much faster, and using less memory
- one last run of dotmemory - all that is found is ok - no point in sacrificing stuff for more memory increases

- Conclusion at this point:
  - at some point I said that 32-bit occupied mem is about the same as 64-bit. I was wrong (see 1.0.76e)
  - x64 version will take about 40% more memory (due to 8-byte pointers)
  - due to memory improvements, I also got some speed improvements
  - 280Mb file loads only on 64-bit - it takes about 2.5Gb of RAM (with full log shown); note: it has 3M lines
  - 280Mb raises exception on 32-bit (out of memory)
  - 90Mb file takes <600Mb on 32-bit . This is HUGE improvement (initially, it took close to twice as much)
  - I really see no more possible improvements at this point without sacrificing something else (very likely, speed and simplicity)
  **** note: the reason the 280Mb and 90Mb files take so much memory is because many of the lines match in a quite a few filters,
       and I had a LOT of views;
       thus, we end up creating a lot of objects. It's very likely that on some of your huge files that won't be the case, and
	   loading a file of this size would take much less memory and cpu


1.0.76f
- the 280Mb file loads in 2.53Gb of RAM

1.0.76e
- apparently, my Release64's actual platform was x86 instead of x64


1.0.76d
- decrease memory footprint - step 9
  - read full log first - apparent 10% less memory consumed (on 90Mb file)


1.0.76c
- decrease memory footprint - step 8
  - done all I said in 1.0.75
  - note: basically the memory itself did not drop by much, ***however***, I did minimize the posibility of an out-of-memory exception 
    due to memory fragmenting


1.0.76b
- fix bug at filter.add_addition_line (not tested)


1.0.76a
- decrease memory footprint - step 7
  - added memory_optimized_list
  - BEFORE making 'filter' - matches member into a list (instead of dictionary)


1.0.75
- decrease memory footprint - step 6
  - removed gcConcurrent="false" (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1267611/net-is-there-a-way-to-change-the-gc-behavior-for-the-entire-machine)
  - allow creating huge objects on x64 (http://www.centerspace.net/blog/large-matrices-and-vectors/)
  - added gcServer enabled="true" (http://content.atalasoft.com/h/i/58213870-choosing-the-right-garbage-collector-settings-for-your-application-net-memory-management-part-4)

- tried loading the full log first, then refreshing filters, this made things worse (filter.compute_matches_impl) - crash even with full log off

- notes: 
  - on 280 Mb file, I still got outofmemory exception when showing full log
  - perhaps a system restart could help
  - since i've updated the above (in app.config), we crash on the huge file

******** possible further improvements
   -stringbuilder -> set its capacity (since we know the size of the original file)
     - also, force a gc.collect level 3 ?
   http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vsofficedeveloper/archive/2008/10/10/stringbuilder-outofmemoryexception.aspx
   - full log -> set capacity of _model to the number of lines
   - have a connection pool of List<T>. then, when items are added, ensure we have the space for them, and we reuse them constantly
     - have a minsize for the number of items (at which, this should start happening)
	 - i should use this on all List<list_view.item> and filter.match?


1.0.74c
- decrease memory footprint - step 5
 - loaded 90Mb file , takes 640Mb instead of 1084Mb (1.0.66) = when showing full log
 - loads 280 Mb file - takes 1170Mb when not showing full log; when full log is shown, it crashes (outofmemoryexception)

******** possible furher improvements: 
  - some of the objects could be created on the stack - like: 
    - log_line_parser.read_to_line (List<line> now)
	- filter.compute_matches_impl (new_matches, new_match_indexes)
	  - here, I could tweak with .Capacity ?
	- log_view.update_view_column (matches)
	- maybe 'match' could be made a struct? careful - not sure if i assume it's pased by value - however, this should be immutable
	  - note : this might actualy backfire, because there are plenty of places holding a match
  - large_string -> indexes_ -> maybe enlarge its capacity as we add new lines? 
    (like, 20% or so - only when needed; have a ratio of: number of lines / existing-string -> thus, get the average line length;
	 then, based on that, we should see if we need to increase indexes_' capacity )
  - filter - matches_ dictionary could become a list - not sure if this would yield that much of an improvement though

  - another possibly big improvement: the line should not keep a reference to the large_string
    - every request for a part of a line would need to send the large_string reference as well
	- this can also backfire, because in list_view.item, we would need to keep a reference to either the large_string, or the parent
	  so very likely no gain would be achieved
	  - the more I think about, the more I think this would bring unnecessary complexity, with very small gains, if any
	    (like, if we move the ref to large_string from line into filter.match, we will end up having more references to large_string,
		 since we can have more matches than lines - if several filters match the lines -> so, not a good idea)


1.0.74b
- decrease memory footprint - step 4 
  - using BitArray instead of bool[]
  - further testing
  - fixed bug from 1.0.74a - works as expected now

Notes:
- I initially thought that compiling as 32-bit would save us quite a lot of memory - this does not seem to be the case.
- memory "bottlenecks" are:
  - line class - not much can be improved about it
  - filter.match - probably a small improvement could be achieved by making filter_line.font_info a struct - however, i don't think it's worth my time at this point
  - *** log_view.item 
    - i could create a class derived from item, for the full-log only -> which would keep the parent_ and matched_logs (note: done: in 1.0.74c)


1.0.74a
- decrease memory footprint - step 3 - large_string now holds the whole string, and the lines point into it
  - rationale: dotmemory found a LOT of small strings
  - IMPORTANT: there is a BUG - at huge files, some lines are missed (huge1.txt - we miss two lines)
    (very likely, we consider they are part of existing lines and append to them)
	also, it's likely that I access some lines before they are fully read (like, a line was partially read) - and i don't treat that correctly

- managed to successfully load 280Mb file - we occupy about 1.1Gb - which is quite decent (older version just crashed)


1.0.73
- decrease memory footprint - step 2 (loaded 90Mb file , takes 515Mb instead of 811Mb (1.0.66))

1.0.72b
- decrease memory footprint - step 1


1.0.72a
- toggling full log -> make sure we focus on a view, so that we don't end up having focus on a hidden control
  - bug: toggle full log -> when pressed ('l') in full-log, it's pressed twice
         note : this did not exist on 1.0.71


1.0.71b
- updated setup kit so that some HM3 log views are there by default


1.0.71
- fix: deal with big files (_test1.HoldemManager.Import.test.txt) -> do profiling
  synchronizing with other views - use binary search


1.0.70b
- deal with homogeneous logs (hm3 files -> several syntaxes)


1.0.70a
- synchronize colors : full log - synchronize with what the existing tab has and/or with all tabs? 
  (Sync: with current tab / with all tabs / none)


1.0.69
- fix - drop one file onto logwizard; then drop another -> press ctrl-f -> the find window is shown behind our window (our window was made topmost somehow?)
  as soon as i drop something -> our window becomes topmost?


1.0.69a
- apply to existing lines
- when changing tab (view) -> we update the filterctrl - we also need to clear curFilterText + applytoexistingfilters


1.0.68
- fix: bug - full log no longer rightly synchronized with current view


1.0.67
- fix: "refresh" -> should clear the existing filter's cache -> so that it updates
  test: go from '\breading\b' 
	-> remove the case-sensitive, then refresh
	-> add it back, then refresh
- added Open in Explorer command (Ctrl-O)
- open with LogWizard - for .log and .txt files
- send to logwizard - for ay file
- fix: on file rewrite (bring to top on restart) 
  -> make sure to navigate to last line!
- fix: on file rewrite (bring to top on restart) 
  -> done: see if i can bring to top+topmost without gaining focus
- help/goto/find/etc - all other forms - if parent is topmost, make topmost as well (othewise they would be covered by parent)


1.0.66
- filters now can match regexes as well. in fact, by default, they work as regexes. If you say:
  $[part-of-line] some-regex-expression, it works as regex.
  Example:
  $msg \breading\b
  - will match all lines containing the word 'reading'
- settings file - save settings in such a way that I can add regexes (namely, don't escape multiple lines the way i used to)
- filter friendly names -> just add a line (anywhere) thta starts with '## ' 
- show the filter in background pink if it's an invalid one
- when you edit the filter, and set the color ('color XXX' line), it will visually show the color


1.0.65
- made logwizard run as invoker again (rationale: now, that i made logwizard run as admin, i can't drop files onto it)
  tested: "bring to top on restart" works as expected


1.0.64
- support non-ascii encodings
- adjust time of lines that could not be parsed
- allow time that uses : as millis separator
- auto recognized msi log files
  - at this time, non homegeneous lines are considered 'just message'
- fix: auto update msg details when toggling
- fix: when filters pane shown, msg details should not override it


1.0.62
- made the icon much smaller


1.0.61
- fix: test on deleted settings file (we used to have problems)


1.0.60
- added application manifest, to request admin credentials -> for topmost to work correctly (still did not work)
- fixed setting topmost - forcing it via win32 messages


1.0.58
- toggle topmost - allow showing even if title is shown as well
- fix: filter buttons not shown properly
- settings by file - easy to have settings by file (bring to top on restart/make topmost no restart)
- bring to top on restart - works as expected, but when another app is full-screen, 
  sometimes TopMost=true is ignored


1.0.57
- toggle topmost works - via button (only when title is not shown)


1.0.56e
- 'T' - toggle title (remove border + lower pane)
- by default -> don't sync views (for large files -> it's slow')


1.0.54
- f5 = refresh
- generate the release build as x64 by default
- whenever something is added - to a view that is not current, show visually (bold) that there are new items there


1.0.52
- go to line/time
  - allow even goodies like +4s and such


1.0.51c
- fix: bug -> sometiems changnig the file stops refresheshing the existing view - probably because of wait_for_filter_to_read_from_new_log_


1.0.51b
- export to clipboard/import from clipboard for filters/full-context
- initial version of settings
- Monitor TN2 - if present (%appdata%\tn2)
- Refresh button - moved next to history


1.0.51a
- filter row: Move to Top / Move To Buttom
- resize log wizard: update message details
- key down - in edit -> don't have it as hotkey


1.0.50
- sync all views to existing view - force all views to go to the closest line 
- show the number of lines in teh tab + show when it changes
  WEIRD BUG: in order for logs to be in sync, i need to go with ctrl-=> to each log. then, they will end up in sync as i change the items


1.0.49
- done, works: check if monitoring the same file - and that file gets rewritten -> everything should go from zero
- updated TableNinja context


1.0.47
- monitoring a file - don't hold _fs internally - so that the other program can write to it
- change icon
- fix: bug when chaning files - now no crash, but some info is not updated


1.0.46
- fix: bug when changing log files 
- tested very big file (280Mb) - works on x64
- msg_details: match the color of the line you're showing details for


1.0.45
- initially added and tested on github


1.0.44
- efficiency : filter is thread-safe
- note: made filter disposable, but at this time we don't need it


1.0.42
- efficiency: reading the log_line_parser / log_line_reader : on their own thread


1.0.41
- efficiency: reading the file on a different thread - doubled the speed (for 32Mb log file)


1.0.40
- working on efficency - small improvement - line.part() does not take a substring of the line


1.0.39
- the last selected item from history -> move to last, so that next time we auto-open it


1.0.38
- made the Filters - into a pane (with several tabs) - I'll allow having several extensions later (like, Allow filtering by thread/context)
- several hotkeys - if focus on edit, they should not work
- allow case-insensitive filters
- allow filtering for "contains any/none"


1.0.37
- clearer UI hints when a certain view becomes active (like, when you within panes with Tab/Shift-tab)
- allow de-synchronizing existing log with full log (until now they were in sync)
- toggle Full Log - allow toggling: view/both/full-log-only


1.0.36
- letter hotkeys - should not work when focus on edit

1.0.35
- +/- hotkeys - increase/decrease font
- m - just the log messages (without the time/etc.) - this applies only to the current view 
(so for instance if full log is present as welll, it would only apply to the current view)
- ctrl-up/down for log, just like it's in notepad++


1.0.34
- setup sample - shown correctly, added SetupSample filters, in order to be shown correctly at setup


1.0.33
- handle showing the setup sample - when running setup
  more importantly, making sure that the setup sample is added to the history, and when shown again, it will care about
  its position in history (by default, we load the last log)
- when setup kit is run, we wait for it to end and then show the setup sample


1.0.28
- tab / shift-tab - work
- up/down arrows - if history dropdown or focus in filters ctrl (filter list/cur filter), do normal behavior
- h - toggle history dropdown (after the dropdown closes, focus back to last known pane)
- ctrl-n - new window
- ctrl-s - settings
- updated help form


1.0.27b
- tooltip - not shown on msg column, the msg_details is shown instead when needed


1.0.27a
- fixed the "tooltip" - made it as control instead of a form (msg_details_ctrl)


1.0.26
- added About form
- added: if current line is too big to show (thus, we would need a tooltip),we can show it as an edit box (or label), behind the line TOTHINK perhaps we would want to turn this off at times?
  show this either at the bottom or at the top (by default, at the bottom)
  HOWEVER It does not FUCKING work. I'm too nervous to investigate - it constantly steals focus from the log wizard - which should NOT happen.


1.0.25
- added Debug64/Release64 configs. Note: on valerie/TableNinja2.log.5 -> it generates on exception on Release64, but no exception on Release
- ctrl-c - copy to clipboard (only the msg) ; ctrl-shift-c - copy full line
- bookmarks work
