- "refresh" -> should clear the existing filter's cache -> so that it updates
  test: go from '\breading\b' 
	-> remove the case-sensitive, then refresh
	-> add it back, then refresh



1.0.66
- filters now can match regexes as well. in fact, by default, they work as regexes. If you say:
  $[part-of-line] some-regex-expression, it works as regex.
  Example:
  $msg \breading\b
  - will match all lines containing the word 'reading'
- settings file - save settings in such a way that I can add regexes (namely, don't escape multiple lines the way i used to)
- filter friendly names -> just add a line (anywhere) thta starts with '## ' 
- show the filter in background pink if it's an invalid one
- when you edit the filter, and set the color ('color XXX' line), it will visually show the color


1.0.65
- made logwizard run as invoker again (rationale: now, that i made logwizard run as admin, i can't drop files onto it)
  tested: "bring to top on restart" works as expected


1.0.64
- support non-ascii encodings
- adjust time of lines that could not be parsed
- allow time that uses : as millis separator
- auto recognized msi log files
  - at this time, non homegeneous lines are considered 'just message'
- fix: auto update msg details when toggling
- fix: when filters pane shown, msg details should not override it


1.0.62
- made the icon much smaller


1.0.61
- fix: test on deleted settings file (we used to have problems)


1.0.60
- added application manifest, to request admin credentials -> for topmost to work correctly (still did not work)
- fixed setting topmost - forcing it via win32 messages


1.0.58
- toggle topmost - allow showing even if title is shown as well
- fix: filter buttons not shown properly
- settings by file - easy to have settings by file (bring to top on restart/make topmost no restart)
- bring to top on restart - works as expected, but when another app is full-screen, 
  sometimes TopMost=true is ignored


1.0.57
- toggle topmost works - via button (only when title is not shown)


1.0.56e
- 'T' - toggle title (remove border + lower pane)
- by default -> don't sync views (for large files -> it's slow')


1.0.54
- f5 = refresh
- generate the release build as x64 by default
- whenever something is added - to a view that is not current, show visually (bold) that there are new items there


1.0.52
- go to line/time
  - allow even goodies like +4s and such


1.0.51c
- fix: bug -> sometiems changnig the file stops refresheshing the existing view - probably because of wait_for_filter_to_read_from_new_log_


1.0.51b
- export to clipboard/import from clipboard for filters/full-context
- initial version of settings
- Monitor TN2 - if present (%appdata%\tn2)
- Refresh button - moved next to history


1.0.51a
- filter row: Move to Top / Move To Buttom
- resize log wizard: update message details
- key down - in edit -> don't have it as hotkey


1.0.50
- sync all views to existing view - force all views to go to the closest line 
- show the number of lines in teh tab + show when it changes
  WEIRD BUG: in order for logs to be in sync, i need to go with ctrl-=> to each log. then, they will end up in sync as i change the items


1.0.49
- done, works: check if monitoring the same file - and that file gets rewritten -> everything should go from zero
- updated TableNinja context


1.0.47
- monitoring a file - don't hold _fs internally - so that the other program can write to it
- change icon
- fix: bug when chaning files - now no crash, but some info is not updated


1.0.46
- fix: bug when changing log files 
- tested very big file (280Mb) - works on x64
- msg_details: match the color of the line you're showing details for


1.0.45
- initially added and tested on github


1.0.44
- efficiency : filter is thread-safe
- note: made filter disposable, but at this time we don't need it


1.0.42
- efficiency: reading the log_line_parser / log_line_reader : on their own thread


1.0.41
- efficiency: reading the file on a different thread - doubled the speed (for 32Mb log file)


1.0.40
- working on efficency - small improvement - line.part() does not take a substring of the line


1.0.39
- the last selected item from history -> move to last, so that next time we auto-open it


1.0.38
- made the Filters - into a pane (with several tabs) - I'll allow having several extensions later (like, Allow filtering by thread/context)
- several hotkeys - if focus on edit, they should not work
- allow case-insensitive filters
- allow filtering for "contains any/none"


1.0.37
- clearer UI hints when a certain view becomes active (like, when you within panes with Tab/Shift-tab)
- allow de-synchronizing existing log with full log (until now they were in sync)
- toggle Full Log - allow toggling: view/both/full-log-only


1.0.36
- letter hotkeys - should not work when focus on edit

1.0.35
- +/- hotkeys - increase/decrease font
- m - just the log messages (without the time/etc.) - this applies only to the current view 
(so for instance if full log is present as welll, it would only apply to the current view)
- ctrl-up/down for log, just like it's in notepad++


1.0.34
- setup sample - shown correctly, added SetupSample filters, in order to be shown correctly at setup


1.0.33
- handle showing the setup sample - when running setup
  more importantly, making sure that the setup sample is added to the history, and when shown again, it will care about
  its position in history (by default, we load the last log)
- when setup kit is run, we wait for it to end and then show the setup sample


1.0.28
- tab / shift-tab - work
- up/down arrows - if history dropdown or focus in filters ctrl (filter list/cur filter), do normal behavior
- h - toggle history dropdown (after the dropdown closes, focus back to last known pane)
- ctrl-n - new window
- ctrl-s - settings
- updated help form


1.0.27b
- tooltip - not shown on msg column, the msg_details is shown instead when needed


1.0.27a
- fixed the "tooltip" - made it as control instead of a form (msg_details_ctrl)


1.0.26
- added About form
- added: if current line is too big to show (thus, we would need a tooltip),we can show it as an edit box (or label), behind the line TOTHINK perhaps we would want to turn this off at times?
  show this either at the bottom or at the top (by default, at the bottom)
  HOWEVER It does not FUCKING work. I'm too nervous to investigate - it constantly steals focus from the log wizard - which should NOT happen.


1.0.25
- added Debug64/Release64 configs. Note: on valerie/TableNinja2.log.5 -> it generates on exception on Release64, but no exception on Release
- ctrl-c - copy to clipboard (only the msg) ; ctrl-shift-c - copy full line
- bookmarks work


1.0.24
- extra column on Fulllog -> shows the views where a line was found. Also, updates based on which view is selected


1.0.23d
- selecting a filter -> marks all lines containing that filter + allows doing f3/shift-f3


1.0.23c
- log view made as ownerdrawn, so that i can specify UnfocusedHightlight color
- saving last search (text/bg/fg)


1.0.23b
- ctrl-f/esc/f3/shift-f3 work correctly


1.0.23a
- hotkeys: action hotkeys (up/down/pgup/etc) if full-log is selected, they should apply to it
- fix: - bug: in full-log, control keys are interpreted twice (such as pgup/pgdn etc)
- ctrl-f/Esc work - basically, we override the fg + bg


1.0.22
- initial settings page (shows hotkeys/tips)
- scheletron for finding text


1.0.21
- added GNU v3 licensing


1.0.20
- as the file is appended to, all the filters update correctly (same for the "full log")
fixes:
- apparently - teh full log is not correctly refreshed as more info is written to it (windows 8/10)
- windows 10: apparently we don't update in time as file is refreshed


1.0.19
- Home key works


1.0.18
- tooltip only if text bigger than col width
- Filter "-" - select something after deletion
- refresh button on the filter: done: not fully tested, seems to work though
- font names: by default fixed width
- previewkeydown/up -> allow global hotkeys


1.0.16
- tested log being constantly appended to/rewritten : works now


1.0.15
- added LogWizardSample file
- refactored log_to_default_context/syntax
- recognize Sample file
- recognize TN2 debug files


1.0.14
- initial tests of log being constantly appended to/rewritten work


1.0.13c
- moved file_text_reader code into simple_file_text_reader
- moved log-syntax related code into find_log_syntax


1.0.13b
- file_text_reader -> make sure pos_ is ulong


1.0.13
- added rewritelogfile - to test logwizard as a file gets rewritten


1.0.11

- setup kit + release mode - keep settings in roaming dir

1.0.6
- allow having the "All" view -> and allow toggling it, and keeping it in sync with active tab.


1.0.5
- implemented additions
- on addition -> gray the original color
- test history (changing files)
- changing the file -> does not automatically update


1.0.4
- remember "toggle" settings
- updated tooltip for "Filter"
- partially implemented additions


1.0.3
- using virtuallist
- refrences to log4net/objectlistview via nuget
- virtuallist works so far


1.0.2
- starting to work - several filters work correctly



1.0.1
- roughtly, UI is ready - need to actually read logs and apply filters
done:
+ deleting a mid-view -> need to update all filters! (since they are kept by indexes)
+ adding a view -> copy all filters from existing view!
+ adding a view -> add it AFTER the existing one (in TabPages)
+ adding a view -> select it
