- take some picture(s) with logwizard - to place on github

-------------------------------------------------------

- parse lines ending in 0xa

- refresh_visibl_columns -> should not be needed - i need to figure this out from logsyntax TOTHINK
  - seee if i can hide columns another way (not by width=0)


  - add aliases as well
    - for line-by-line -> write the name in {} -> when used in filtering, it should be lower-case






- filters - when refreshing 
  (especially on "apply to existing")
  -> run all filters (until they are all run (those not for only-apply-to-existing-filters), nothing changes (in the view))
  ----------------> AFTER they are all run (we change the whole array in ONE step)
                   (this way when refreshing and the same number of lines -> it's instant and perfect)
- on 50K lines, the refresh takes rather long - it should not take this long
  - like, creating a new view takes a bit - this should be close to instant
    + refreshing - should not re-read the file if it's not changed!!! 
	  + parser - should reread from scratch only if syntax has changed!
----------------> what i need is different types of refresh: current view, current file, all views, etc. TOTHINK
---------- while refreshing, show this ON THE STATUS message







	- allow toggling "matches filter(s) X,Y,Z ON/OFF" - this toggle should be customizable (several filters or simply just an extra function?)
	  - in other words, say i may have a filter or several filters
	    a. i want to be able to say "at this point, show only messages from these filters" BUT easily be able to toggle back to "show everything in this view"
		b. i want to be abe to also do "show everything in the current log (while preserving the filters)" and easily be able to toggle back
		  - i need to modify the way the log model is kept - i will need to keep 3 models: the view itself, the toggled-view (a.), the full-log-view
		    - very likely - i need to share the full-log-view between all views
			- need to think about memory efficiency
	- teh logview needs to refresh and also, old_item_count_ / last_item_count_while_current_view_  -> see how to update them
	--------- IMPORTANT: this needs to work even when new lines are added!!!!!!! (like, monitoring live)
	 - when on a line when showing all logs 
	   -> right click should show teh "Include lines starting/containing"
	   -> we should not have "Filter/Goto ..." menu
	   - tothink about the rest
    - toggling - will preserve the seleted row + its location on the screen!!! (based on its rectangle bounds - computed the first row that is visible, and scroll to there)

	-- at this point, i need to update the filter menu (based on whether current line matches the filters or not)

  *************perhaps i need an extra "Include only lines containing/starting with ???" (for when user hasn't made any filters)

- filter regex: RegexOptions.Singleline

- find: have a "To Filter" button (good when doing regex search)
- improve find dialog:
  have combo box with the latest 20 searches (for each search, we save everything - like, it's text/regex, colors, casesensitive etc)
   - if i edit something selected from the combo, save it there
   - if i select something from the combo -> move to last (the first to be shown next time)
   - if history contains at least 2 items, automatically drop combo when shown

- improve find: find-type as you go - very useful for regexes: basically
  have a testing 500-1000 lines from the beginning of the current view, in which we "test-the find", and as soon as we find something, we insta-show it
     (basically, the lines should be from around the current line +/- a number of lines below and after)
	 (two ways - either only show the $msg + $line, or everything ) 
	 + exclude $line from the search!!!
    -> show how many times the text was found
  and for regexes, if it's a bad regex, show it in red
  + allow giving friendly names to the regexes, so in the future we can easily reselect them - this needs to be available only for regexes (for normal searches, makes no sense)
  + find: in preview -> when finding something, select it and auto-filter it (so that only the lines containing the text will be shown)


- font: allow changing it

- bug: drag drop a file from a different context -> not all view names (in tabcontrol) are changed

- bug: selecting a word and pressing f3 will take you correctly, but will select the former selection as well
- bug: selecting something with arrow right, and then pressing arrow left will select an extra char from left instead of acting as backspace

- bug notes export: they are not sorted by id when expoted
- bug: next bookmark does not sync with full log

- parse by line "xx: yy", and empty line is end-of-record
  = take care of the case when we read a partial entry




-- article: filter your logs inside out! 
  tagline: Editing Filtes can now be a joy! / Log viewing can be a joy!
  example: have a filter that shows all numbers in red (white bg) - how amazing is that?
   or maybe, telephone numbers
		There are quite a few reasons you'll want to do logging in your application, but lets settle for the most common: 
		* find bugs, 
		* find as much information when something goes south.

		In both cases, you will need to deeply analyze your log. And I'm not saying - just dump some chart about how many errors were found or about how many requests your application handled, or whatever.

		I'm talking about really analyzing your log - to understand what actually happened. Filtering through the log, picking the right information, until you find out what let to the bug/problem.




- notes article: if feedback is positive, perhaps allow easy sharing of notes over intranet
  (so that you automatically save your notes on the intranet as well, and as you load them, you automatically merge them with what is there)
    - easy way to do: each user writes its notes to intranet into a guid-named file (thus - each user will only write its files so there are no clashes)
	  - you simply know the guid of the other users, and auto-import their notes 
	    - (need to find a way to know all the authors for a given file) -> probably use the guid that identifies the file and suffix it by the author name (to think what to do when user changes author name)




























   ------------> perhaps threads first (i think it's less code???? TOTHINK)

- option: if a line doesn't match any logging syntax -> assume it's from previous line (keep it in the context?; probably - yes)

- alert -> allow showing a msg, beep, etc. when a certain msg is found
  for instance "same scrape" -> show a message when that happens
  or, when "overridden theme" gets written (for alerts - force refresh of the view all the time)
  by default -> the alert would show the message itself + perhaps beep?
  alerts - to be also shown in a left pane (as a new tab)
  when an alert happens -and it actually matches the current view - just show the alert sign (no need to show the message itself since the user already sees it)
  --------> when an alert happens, show it in the line number as an "!" icon - also, all views that contain an alert should have the "!" icon
  --------> checkbox - beep on alert + checkbox - bring LogWizard to top on alert
  ----- i should look for an alert in all the filters (in other words, maybe two filters match a line -> the first filter gives the color; but maybe the second one matches the alert)

  -> alerts - allow an alert to stop the program (have setting: alerts : break into code, default = yes).
     in this case, I need to create a special logger (that writes to shmem). then, use signals - after each log, we wait until the "alert" filters have been run
	 if an alert triggers (one that should be on - if "break into code" is turned off, then an alert must be specifically set to "break"),
	 then we stop the program. otherwise, the program continue
	 in our program -> we first run the 'alert' filters that can break (synchronously) - if anything matches, we signal this. otherwise, we allow the original program
	 (the one being debugged), to continue.
	 (note: see if it's easier to monitor for console)
	 note: when writing to shmem, the log pattern should match what you would write the the file.
	 (shmem -> have a setting - how to identify the beginning of hte program - like, a specific message gets written -> restarts logging)

  - new article (about monitoring your own log while debugging) + "bring to top/most on alt-tab"? "Logging and Debugging - they can get along"

  - alert: email? later = command line client that would monitor a certain log? and just do alerts? (include the msg?)
    - cmd line args: [type-of-log] [log-name]
	- allow dumping one of hte views?
	- TOTHINK when should we dump an email? by default, probably not. maybe only on the command line client?
	- later: in time, allow for this to be very thin (memory-wise), since we don't need to remember the matches - we only need to dump alerts, if needed
	- cmd line client should also be able to dump a certain view into another file (.txt or .html); this way, you might run it on Test results?










            



- threads - allow showing threads in parallel - based message id - if too many threads, allow choosing which threads to show - sorted by absolute time
  - this should basically be by assigning a color to each thread's BACKGROUND. Then update the background for each line accordingly
    say we have 3 threads: one, two, three and assign to them : red, green, yellow
	we will have an extra column (perhaps the thread column anyway) what will divide itself into the number or different colors (3)
	then, based on this, it will show one of the 3 in a certain color (red, green, yellow) - each of the different colors will get a different slot
	then, 
	- the background of EACH line will update to a ligher version of the given thread color (like red -> very light red)
	- whenever a line is selected, all the lines from the same thread will be shown on a slighly darker background than usual (like red -> light red)
	   - same thing happens when the line is selected in the "threads" pane 
	    - TOTHINK how many shades of the given color i should have - since it's the normal color, then selected color, then other lines of the same color
		- also perhaps, have a way to toggle the "thread colors" on/off - so that i can have these colors even if the threads pane is off.
	- once i select a color (allow for common colors as well)
	  - if another thread has the same color -> change the other thread's color
	--> (pro_v) same with any context or anything that can be a "filter". In other words, categorize by something (like, a module or so) 
	    i should allow by other contexts, with the following: at most 10 contexts (the, pro_v)
	+ save everything the user selects (colors, how he categorizes) - TOTHINK how?
	- article: LogWizard - Threading can be easy - Thread Filters
	 ------- also, explain that you can toggle:
	           - on only currently shown thread (from view) 
			   - only current shown thread (from full log) 
			   - everything (from full log) + everything (from view) 
			   - which is the view itself




















- preview mode (probably not pro_v)
  - in this mode, we only load part of the file, like, first 50K lines or so
  - also, we stop monitoring for new lines (so we don't interfere with the view/filter creation process)
  - when toggling ON/OFF - show in status (as WARNING), that we're in Preview or not
  - in preview mode, filters will run a LOT faster
    - allow setting the preview mode - how many lines, from where (beginning or end, or half begging half end)
  - when it's a large file, and we don't have any filters, dump a warning
    - by default, on large files, we should automatically toggle preview-mode ON (setting "Auto toggle preview mode on new files larger than X")
  - first and last lines in PREVIEW mode should be something like "YOU ARE IN PREVIEW MODE"
    - so that the user is instantly aware of it
  - Preview mode is on a file-by-file basis (not context-dependent)
  - *** if not pro_v -> article about it?





















- "start monitoring" have a list in settings of locations to monitor
  - at the first sign of a file that was rewritten -> select that file
  (stoppable with ESC)
  - awesome when debugging several apps -> thus, you can have several custom locations - move there, then "start monitoring" and the file is selected
   (care if the file is already open in another window)
   useful even wehn debugging a single app at a time.





- low pane: all buttons should become images + have icons for find/find next/find prev + tothink : should i add icons for anything else?

- bug: toggling enabled/dimmed will end up causing exceptions - seems it's because of all the forced reloads

- smart edit: 
  - allow synchronizing what i type-search with full log (that is, show in both current view and full log) 
    - both ways, from current view to full log and back
  - allow synchronizing full log - match color with current view

- view the event log + article -- 
  http://www.aspheute.com/english/20000811.asp
  http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/14455/Eventlog-Viewer
  http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/91/WindowsNT-Event-Log-Viewer
		- debug viewer (OutputDebugString)
		  https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb896647.aspx
		  https://github.com/djeedjay/DebugViewPP (Dbgviewreader.cpp, dblogreader.cpp)
		  -------> to make this really useful, from process-id -> get the process name. Thus, you can make a filter based on process name, that will always be meaningful
  -- implement toggle details 
     - allow several details in there
	 - allow specifying which columns to be in details, and which in list (they can overlap)
	 - save column widths / positions in global_ui

---------- for non-file logs (like, event log, db, sockets?, outputdebugstring)
 - i need to have extra options for each (like, outputdebugstring -> filter by application name(s))
   - i also need to allow caching (pro_v?)
     - like, remember the last "X" sessions, the user should be able to always bring back any former sessions, and also filter by date(s)
	 - very likely: i should store them locally, but only allow access on pro_v










- logging article??? c# - like, when to log, what to log, logging libs (log4net,nlog), performance, async logging















- 'alt-d' toggle details - this is the beginning of a larger feature -> allow showing details about the message (like, certain columns should show up in the list, and certain in the details - they can overlap)
  if turned on, the msg details is automatically off
  - i should also have a way to toggle msg_details on/off

- allow files from http / ftp (+ allow settings for each type of text reader - in this case - by default, cache it)
- parsing xml/csv?
	allow .csv files, .xml, and merge files 
		-- at this point, i need to have "details" pane + when smart searching -> allow including the non-visible columns (like, those shown in Details)
		-- also, category -> picture should work for the event type
		-- at this point 
		   - xml/csv can contain LOTS of information - thus, our line class will probably not be enough
		     - so, i will need to create an ext_line class allowing up to 50 columns or so
			 - when creating filters - i should be able to filter by column names instead of things like $ctx5 
			   - need to create a string-to-column-name correspondence (by default, all column names correspond to themselves, then we can add aliases)
			     TOTHINK where should we keep the aliases (in context?) + what do we do when we have a filter line whose alias we can't find?
  -- toggle details -> explain how you can set-up your own customized details.
     - article (other types of files - xml, csv)
	   - merge files - even if with different extensions - TOTHINK what the max size should be for when not pro_v (maybe up to 10K lines) TOTHINK
	   ---> when something changes anywhere, i have to notify parent instantly (which probably can query all children first, then update everything )
	        + avoid infinite loop (when child notifies parent, parent queries again, child notifies parent etc.)






























- filtering right click - just like right now we only do filter on msg row, allow other rows as well (pro_v)





- (pro_v) allow using the surrounding lines - if a $part ends in a number, it's the prev/next line. 
  Example: $msg[2] (the second line from now), $time[-3] (the time 3 lines above), $thread[-12] (the thread 12 lines above)
  allow concatenating of several messages - like: $msg[-1,2] = prev msg + enter + msg + enter + next msg + next+1 msg
  This should be: 
  if "apply to existing lines" is checked -> the lines are only taken from this view
  if "apply to existing lines" is unchecked -> lines are taken from the log
  ------ need to remove RegexOptions.Singleline



- (pro_v) show delta - that is, how many millisecs from start? (maybe in secs or so?)
  this should be possible to be shown also from selected line (like, above are with "-", below with "+")
  -- 3 types of delta : compare to start, compare to previous line, compare to current selection
     - also, i should have a "min delta show period", like, lets say, 10ms - for diffs that are not at least this much, don't show them
	   this way, i don't clutter the user with too much useless data, since anyway, he can look at the time, if he wants to
	   maybe show with different colors as well, based on distance - also, allow showing them graphically?
	   also, have a setting like "show exact times" - if off, we'll round to seconds/minutes/etc. BUT
	     if "show exact times on selection" is on, when selecting a row, we'll show the exact times



  - log syntax: should be grayed, so that you edit it in a different more user friendly manner.
    basically, you would have a "..." button
	if we can't figure out the syntax (msg[0] or just time+msg), say so in the Status (Err or Warn)
	perhaps if we can't figure the syntax: auto show the Source pane, otherwise, hide it perhaps?




- bug: when using rewritefile - using the C:\john\code\buff\win10-3\TableNinja2.log.7.rewritten.log -> writing 100 items at once, when they are added to a view that has no filters
  the line ending in 98 is sometimes not written fully (doing a refresh fixes the issue)
  i think the problem is that i'm reading a partial line and matching against that - very likely i should not include the last line until some time has passed or fully read













- creating filters tutorial - have 2 tutorials for creating the same views (the views for TN2scrapepot) - one when editing filters manually, one with selecting words, and converting them to filters






- defaults: retest when using logwizard for first time 
  - also, Find -> have a button "Append to Filter" or something -> if the view name is "New_...", rename this as the contents of the search or something TOTHINK
  - right click on a column -> have an easy "Filter In/Out" dialog where the user can choose to execute something on that column
    - make sure we can do this with keys - i need to have a way to select a certain column with keys - so that when rightclicking on it, it would then open the Filter In/Out dialog
	  -- i should print the existing selected cell (column) with a slightly darker background (perhaps just use left/right arrows?)
	     probably: by default, there is no cell celected (just the row) - if pressing ->, we'll start selecting from the left-to-right
		                                                                - if pressing <-, we'll start selecting from right-to-left
	- the defaults (to filter IN or OUT) should be based on whether in current view or full log









- settings page: 
  - font for showing the message (like, Courier New?)
  - show column "Filter(s)" on full log (it takes more time to synchronize) (Speed tab)
  - colors for bookmarks
  - if to add "*" to the tab title when something changed -> this forces refresh of all  tabs all the time (Speed tab)

- level column -> allow transforming it into pictures
  - this should work on any column - we should be able to transform any context into picts
  - there should be 2 ways: to picture, to text + picture (when to-picture only -> take a lot less space(width))
  - (pro_v) - i should allow regexes for the categorizing a column into pictures (allow to-picture or to-picture + to-picture + space)

- article: testing with logwizard (allow command line as well?) 






- move file locally (toggle its location? - between current location/saved location)
  the idea is to move the file to a logwizard location and store it there - in case you usually keep logs in a temp dir which is sometimes deleted
  maybe i could have this automatically for logs having notes (only those not imported - those imported are already saved locally)?



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------













- merging views into a given context (say two people are working on the same context) - you should be able to "import" the other guy's views without screwing your own
  (by default, back the current settings - just in case something goes wrong)
  - so in other words, say my collegue goes to Copy to clipboard a full context -> and sends it to me - I should be able to merge it with myown
  - new views are extremely easy - (I just add them)
  - existing views with different filters -> do i just add the new filters, erase existing ones? not really sure - perhaps a dialogue asking user what to do












- allow showing/hiding views (pro_v)
  this would be for when you don't want that view to be visible (when you have too many, or - some might be very complex, and take a lot of time to run)
  when a view is hidden - we don't run its filters (unless any of them are "alerts")
  - when shown back, run the filters





- finding regex (pro_v) -> allow matching certain numbers etc. from the log lines, and then allow 
  - having charts based on them
  - or toggle on/off the results based on what was matched
  - from the regex -> from each line, we can extract several numbers -> we should be able to name each such number, and create charts based on them.
  - have a wizard that shows how to do this (for instance, on the wizard, take the 1000 first lines, and generate stuff, so that the user can create the chart;
    then, be able to run it on all data.)

- graphs/charts (pro_v?)
  - by default -> on timeline (like, have timeline from start to end, then, show on timeline, when most messages are written)
  - more: allow extracting the data from the lines themselves - like, [time] -> take off the ms from there, and allow showing graph data from there
          (+ ignore the lines that don't match[yes/no] - if yes, we create the graph with only matched data; if no, we create the graph with empty lines where there are no matches)
  - allow zooming on the chart? tothink
  - switching from graph to log and vice versa needs to be ***seamless***
  - while in the chart/graph - i should be able to move with hotkeys as well
  
- timeline (pro_v)
  - i need to be able to show each view (lines by color?) on timeline - for instance, be able to find where exactly (on the timeline) are most messages, errors, etc
  - i need to account for several days in this case (care about date/time, not just time)

- merge files - allow merging several files (we will allow up to some decent size, like 50M, then pro_v - proabbly just 10K lines)

- probably 500Mb+ files (pro_v? optimize some stuff for such files)















------------- talk with Vidi
- allow copy-paste of full-log into a cloud

- file:line (pro_v) -> allow showing the actual source code , eventually integrate with visual studio, 
  eventually think about root folder / and allow overriding it to your own
  integrate with github/bitbucket for open source projects? - look for api from github/bitbucket for retrieving files
  
- in visual studio -> if i'm at file:line -> go into logwizard and see what messages were written at this file:line -> create a view with those lines or something like that
