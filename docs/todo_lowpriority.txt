- loading large files -> optimize logwizard to load stuff 100% in the background, and show in the status bar as we're loading stuff (first file, then filters)

- show/hide views altogether -> allow hiding the views that don't interest you at this time
  (you might want to re-show them later, but for now, you don't care about them)

- allow hiding views - in case we have too many (we can show them at any time)
- mark views as "should never happen" - the idea is that we would want something like this:
    - have alerts on this view -> if any alert triggers, show this view - otherwise, keep it hidden
    = run on command line as well?

- parse log4net patterns: example: "%-50file(%4line): %date{HH:mm:ss,fff} %-10thread %-5level - %message%newline"
  if a .config file found, read it from there - prefer the pattern after FileAppender


- notes: have a setting: don't show deleted notes older than X days/hours - so that when toggling this ON, when you see hte deleted notes,
  you probably don't care about old ones - this probably makes sense when having lots of notes over the course of several days and so
  - it's so that i don't have to UNDO ever - even notes written by yourself, if you delete them, they are still visible
