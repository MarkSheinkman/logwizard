- loading large files -> optimize logwizard to load stuff 100% in the background, and show in the status bar as we're loading stuff (first file, then filters)

- show/hide views altogether -> allow hiding the views that don't interest you at this time
  (you might want to re-show them later, but for now, you don't care about them)

- allow hiding views - in case we have too many (we can show them at any time)
- mark views as "should never happen" - the idea is that we would want something like this:
    - have alerts on this view -> if any alert triggers, show this view - otherwise, keep it hidden
    = run on command line as well?

- parse log4net patterns: example: "%-50file(%4line): %date{HH:mm:ss,fff} %-10thread %-5level - %message%newline"
  if a .config file found, read it from there - prefer the pattern after FileAppender


- notes: have a setting: don't show deleted notes older than X days/hours - so that when toggling this ON, when you see hte deleted notes,
  you probably don't care about old ones - this probably makes sense when having lots of notes over the course of several days and so
  - it's so that i don't have to UNDO ever - even notes written by yourself, if you delete them, they are still visible

- notes: allow PURGING a note- ONLY possible on your own notes
        this does indeed delete the note, and will purge it when merging as well
		tihs will mark the note as "empty" and purged. 
		When you merge such a note, it's marked as PURGED.
		If there are replies on such a note, they won't be deleted, the text of the purged note will become "NOTE PURGED."

- when allowing more types of logs (like: not just from file)
  - at this point, it would make sense to have an option to save the log (the full log) to file

- notes: whether we keep fast/slow/by-file-name
  - this should be context dependent! it makes sense - for a certain type of files, we probably want just to have 'by file name'
